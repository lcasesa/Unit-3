            Diabetes in The Golden State
          </div>
          <div class="information">
            California is the most populous state in the country with more than 39 million residents. 
            Of that 39+ million, approximately 3,209,418 people in California, or 10.5% of the adult population,
             have been diagnosed with diabetes. An additional 884,000 people in California have diabetes but 
             do not know it, greatly increasing their health risk. There are 10,320,000 people in California, 
             33.4% of the adult population, who have prediabetes with blood glucose levels that are higher than 
             normal but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. Every year an estimated 272,814 people 
             in California are diagnosed with diabetes. (American Diabetes Association)
